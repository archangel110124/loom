//! Wind → waves: the Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum, sampled into a wave set.
//!
//! **Nobody authors amplitudes.** A sea has one honest input — how hard the
//! wind is blowing — and every other number about it follows. Hand-tuning
//! sixteen amplitudes produces a sea that is right at one wind speed and wrong
//! at every other, and there is nothing in the file to say which one it was
//! tuned for.
//!
//! # The reference-height trap
//!
//! Pierson–Moskowitz is defined against the wind at **19.5 m** above the
//! surface. JONSWAP and every modern reference use **U10**, at 10 m. Mixing
//! them silently mis-sizes the sea by 5–10% in wind and 10–20% in wave height,
//! with no error anywhere, which is why it is written down three times here:
//!
//! - **[`wave_set`] takes U10**, because that is what a Beaufort number, a
//!   forecast and every published table mean by "wind speed".
//! - It converts to U19.5 with [`U19_5_PER_U10`] before touching the spectrum.
//! - **`loom_field`'s authored `Wind::speed` is neither.** That field's height
//!   profile saturates toward `speed` as height goes to infinity, so `speed` is
//!   a free-stream value and is roughly 10% *above* U10. Convert it with
//!   `loom_field::wind::Wind::mean_speed_at(10.0)`; never pass it here raw.
//!
//! # Why there is no Slang twin
//!
//! This runs on the CPU, once, when the wind changes — it produces the sixteen
//! waves that the shader then evaluates through [`crate::sample_water`], which
//! *does* have a twin and is the only thing per-vertex. Generating the
//! spectrum on the GPU would mean sixteen `ln`s and a `sqrt` chain per vertex
//! to recompute a constant.
//!
//! # Fetch, and why a fully-developed sea is the wrong default for a game
//!
//! [`wave_set`] is Pierson–Moskowitz, which is the *fully-developed* limit —
//! the wind has blown forever over unlimited water — and that limit is
//! **scale-invariant**. `m0 ∝ U⁴` and `ω_p ∝ 1/U` give `A ∝ U²` and
//! `k ∝ U⁻²`, so `k·A` — slope, steepness, every quantity a normal, a
//! whitecap or a hull responds to — is *algebraically independent of the
//! wind*. Measured over the whole legal range, `Σ Q·k·A` is 0.327 at every
//! wind speed there is. **Raising the wind zooms the sea; it never roughens
//! it**, and at U10 = 18 the shortest wave in the world is 94 m and a
//! nineteen-metre boat is a cork on one tilting plane.
//!
//! [`wave_set_fetch`] is the fix and it is honest physics, not a fudge: a sea
//! that has only crossed `F` metres of open water is smaller than the
//! fully-developed one **and steeper**, and steepens as `U^⅓`. One scene
//! fact — how much open water is upwind — buys the thing a game wants from
//! wind and PM refuses to sell.
//!
//! This module's earlier note said a fetch "would be a number with no source,
//! tuned by hand, which is the thing this module exists to abolish". That
//! holds for amplitudes and not for fetch: sixteen amplitudes have no
//! referent, and a coastal fishing ground genuinely has a distance to the
//! shore. It is one number, in metres, with a meaning outside this file.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not built
//!
//! **JONSWAP's peak enhancement, `γ = 3.3`.** It narrows the spectrum about
//! its peak and moves neither `Hs` nor `ω_p` — the only two numbers sixteen
//! equal-energy bands can carry — and it has no closed-form cumulative, which
//! is exactly what makes [`bands`] exact rather than approximate.
//! [`wave_set_fetch`] is therefore *fetch-limited PM*: PM's shape, JONSWAP's
//! two parameters.
